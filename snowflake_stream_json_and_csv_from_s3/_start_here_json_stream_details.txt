In this script, I build a streaming data pipeline of json data from S3 to Snowflake using sql, a custom AWS IAM role, an AWS S3 bucket, and AWS SNS. This is the code which allows me to show you how when I drop a json file or csv file into an s3 bucket, the data becomes available in snowflake moments later.
